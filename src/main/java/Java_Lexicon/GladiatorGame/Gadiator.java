//  What i need for this Game to work:
/*
 * 1. I need a random Name Generator. ( Optional )
 * 2. I need a random Number Generator.
 * 3. I need to generate an Enemy gladiator.
 * 4. I need to make the player able to create, enter and store a name for their Gladiator and any other attributes.
 * 5. I need to make  the Gladiators to store the name given as long as they are alive.
 * 6. I need to make their HP go down when either the player or gladiator wins the round depending on who get the bigger random number.
 * 7. I need to generate a new enemy when the player wins.
 * 8. I need to make sure the player and enemy got the same health at the start of a new round.
 * 9. I need to store and add to the score the player gets for each win or when the player dies
 * 10.I need to make the player able to end the game when the player wants to and show it current score.
 * 11. ...whatever i can come up with i guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
